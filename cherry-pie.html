    <h3>Description:</h3>


    <p>Cherry pie filled with ripe sweet cherries is a summer favorite. This easy pie can be made with fresh or frozen sweet cherries. A touch of almond extract in the filling and a light hand with the sugar helps the cherries shine.</p>

    <p> <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pie dough</li>
        <li>5 cups of sweet cherries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Coarse sugar</li>
     </ul>
     </p>

     <p> <h3>Steps:</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Place the pitted cherries, sugar, almond extract, lemon juice and cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss until the cherries are well coated with the sugar and other ingredients.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured clean surface, roll out the bottom crust. Form it into a 9- or 10-inch pie pan. Using kitchen scissors, trim the edges so that they extend beyond the edge of the pie pan by 1 inch. Place in the refrigerator while you roll out the top crus</li>
        <li>Roll out the top crust to about the same size as the bottom crust.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to lift the cherries out of the bowl and put them in the pie plate. (Leave any excess liquid behind.) Dot with small dabs of butter. Cover with the top crust. Trim the edges. Crimp to seal the edges together.</li>
        <li>Score the top crust with several cuts so that the steam can escape while the pie is cooking (unnecessary if you are making a lattice crust). Chill the pie for 30 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the egg with a tablespoon of water or milk. Use a pastry brush to brush over the top crust. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temp to 350°F and cook for 45 to 55 minutes longer, or until the crust is nicely browned and the filling is thick and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
