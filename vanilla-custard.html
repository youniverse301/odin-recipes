    <h3>Description:</h3>


    <p>This vanilla custard is extra rich with heavy cream and egg yolks. Serve it on its own like a pudding, spoon it over fruit, or layer it into a trifle!</p>

    <p> <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (28g) cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 cups (480ml) whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>
     </p>

     <p> <h3>Steps:</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>In a medium, heat-proof mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks and whisk until the mixture is pale and smooth, about 1 minute. If your mixing bowl doesn’t have a non-slip bottom, place the bowl on a damp towel so it doesn’t slide in the next step. Keep your bowl close by the stove.</li>
        <li>In a heavy-bottomed, medium saucepan over medium-low heat bring the milk and cream to a simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from scorching. The milk and cream should just come to a simmer with small bubbles along the edges of the pan. Don’t let it reach a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>As soon as the milk and cream come to a simmer, take the pan off the heat. With one hand, slowly pour the hot milk into the yolk mixture a splash at a time, while whisking constantly with your other hand. The damp towel under the mixing bowl should prevent it from sliding around while whisking.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard back into the saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the custard begins to simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Once it begins to gently bubble, continue to cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds longer to cook out the starch.</li>
        <li>Remove the custard from the heat. Whisk in the butter until melted and completely incorporated. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard. Refrigerate until cool, at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Whisk the custard until smooth before serving.</li>
    </ol>
